Overview
--------

BRL-CAD consists primarily of libraries, applications, scripts,
documentation, geometric models, images, data resources, and build
infrastructure.  The BRL-CAD libraries provide their headers in the
include/ directory as well as all of the directories that begin with
the prefix "lib" in the src/ directory.  All of BRL-CAD's libraries,
applications, and any content lacking a library specification are
covered by the terms of the LGPL.

Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure, a variety of scripts, and the
testing infrastructure (scripts and resources) are provided under the
BSD license and/or are in the public domain.  Similarly, most of the
geometric models, images, and other data resources are also provided
under the BSD license.  Refer to each individual file for specific
terms.

Unless otherwise denoted, all of BRL-CAD's documentation is made
available under the terms of the BSD Documentation License (BDL).
Refer to each document for specific terms.

The full text of the LGPL, BDL, and BSD license should be included in
the source distribution of BRL-CAD in the doc/legal/ directory.  Refer
